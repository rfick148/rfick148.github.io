        <h2>Sophomore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a sophomore at Bob Jones University studying visual studies. I have previously taken oil and acrylic painting classes and now I am currently taking ceramics.</p>
         <p> 
            When I attended my home church: The Father's House, in California, I volunteered in the Kids' Ministry for fifth through sixth graders. I volunteered on Saturday night and Sunday morning services. I would minister and also work the lights and sound on the Kids' Worship Team. 
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also love to skateboard and try new tricks on it.
